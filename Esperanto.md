Hi everyone,

We are researcher at the University of Southampton and Lyon, working on supporting underserved language communities in Wikipedia.

We need your help!
We worked on generating text in your language, and want to study and understand the quality of the text. 

Therefore, we have two questionnaires, we need answers for. Both are equally important.

The first, which can be found here: https://www.isurvey.soton.ac.uk/25258 </br>
We want to understand the quality of the text, and how well the text fits into the general writing of Wikipedia.

The second, which can be found here: https://www.isurvey.soton.ac.uk/25235 </br>
We are evaluating the factual content of the generated text and whether the facts represented in it are coherent or not.

Both surveys have about 50 questions, but if you just want to answer part of the questions, that’s absolutely fine. If you use the save option, you can also come back anytime and edit it.
The survey is open until 22/10/2017.

Thank you very much for your participation. It will help to bring the support for Esperanto online a lot forward! 

If you have any comments and questions, please feel free to reach out to us!
