Hi everyone,

We are researcher at the University of Southampton and Lyon, working on supporting underserved language communities in Wikipedia.

We need your help!
We worked on generating text in your language, and want to understand the quality of the text and how editors would interact with the text. 
Therefore, we set up a questionnaire here https://www.isurvey.soton.ac.uk/25256.

It will show information and we want to ask you to edit based on the fact and text shown - without using any external tools. It will help us understand how facts are put in words and how to interact with existing text.

The survey has 30 questions, but if you just want to answer part of the questions, that’s absolutely fine. If you use the save option, you can also come back anytime and edit it.
The survey is open until 22/10/2017.

Thank you very much for your participation. It will help to bring the support for Esperanto online a lot forward! 

If you have any comments and questions, please feel free to reach out to us!
